I am an Android developer with 7 years' experience, currently employed in [Tinkoff.ru][tinkoff].

Occasionally I give talks on meet-ups and conferences (list of my talks is on the [projects page](/projects/#talks)) and teach students Android at [Tinkoff Finctech school][tfs].

I also do [photography][instagram], sometimes helping my friends at local [Sofar Sounds community][sofar].

In love with coffee.

My other interests include Rubik's cube, cardistry and 3D graphics.
