[Shisen-Sho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shisen-Sho) (also known as Four-Rivers or simply Rivers) is a mahjong-like game,
where the player needs to match similar tiles in pairs until all tiles are removed from the board.

{% include image.html url="/assets/posts/shisen-sho-bfs/kshisen.jpg" description="<a href='https://apps.kde.org/kshisen/'>KShisen</a>" %}

In this article I will cover usage of [breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) in implementation of Shisen-Sho game.

# 1. Rules

The main difference with classic mahjong solitaire games is that to remove two tiles, they must have a _connection_,
and the connection path must not exceeed two 90Â° turns (in other words: the connection can have at most 3 segments).
The connection path must be free of tiles and can't have diagonal segments.

There are 3 different types of connections:

1. One segment

    ![One segment](/assets/posts/shisen-sho-bfs/1-segment.png)
2. Two segments

    ![Two segments](/assets/posts/shisen-sho-bfs/2-segments.png)
3. Three segments

    ![Two segments](/assets/posts/shisen-sho-bfs/3-segments.png)

# 2. Finding a path

There are several ways to find a path between the tiles.

Here's description of algorithm which [FreeShisen](https://github.com/knilch0r/freeshisen) app uses:

```
ALGORITHM TO COMPUTE CONNECTION PATH BETWEEN PIECES A (IA,JA) AND B (IB,JB)
- Delete A and B from the board (consider them as blank spaces)
- Calculate the set H of possible horizontal lines in the board (lines through blank spaces)
- Calculate the set V of possible vertical lines in the board
- Find HA, VA, HB, VB in the sets
- If HA=HB, result is a straight horizontal line A-B
- If VA=VB, result is a straight vertical line A-B
- If HA cuts VB, the result is an L line A-(IA,JB)-B
- If VA cuts HB, the result is an L line A-(IB,JA)-B
- If exists an V line that cuts HA and HB, the result is a Z line A-(IA,JV)-(IB-JV)-B
- If exists an H line that cuts VA and VB, the result is a Z line A-(IV,JA)-(IV,JB)-B
```

Basically, this is a brute-force search, which is pretty ineffective. It also does not yield the shortest paths.

Another approach is implemented in [kshisen](https://invent.kde.org/games/kshisen):

1. Find a simple path:
    * if tiles are located in the same row or column, the path might be a straight line
2. Find two segments path:

    ![Two segments search](/assets/posts/shisen-sho-bfs/2-segments-search.png)

    There are two options for a possible path (red and green lines).

3. Find three segments path:

    From first tile position go in all directions (left, top, right, bottom) and try to find a two segments path to
    second tile, for example:

    ![Three segments search](/assets/posts/shisen-sho-bfs/3-segments-search.gif)

It is the more efficient method, compared to the brute-force, since we perform search only in part of the game field.
And *most of the time* this algorithm will provide the shortest paths.

<details>
<summary><em>A note on shortest paths</em></summary>
<blockquote>
In some cases the algorithm will produce suboptimal paths.
<br/>
In a situation where two or more possible paths exist, the solution will depend on in which direction you go first in the 3rd step.
</blockquote>
</details>

In breadth-first search version we will use a similar technique.

# 3. Breadth-first search

On each iteration of algorithm expand search in all directions (left, top, right, bottom), keeping track of number of remaining turns.

The outline of an algorithm to find a path from tile `A` to tile `B`:

1. Create a `queue` for storing nodes
2. **Expand** the start node `A`, add them to `queue`
3. If `queue`:
    * is empty - no path from `A` to `B`, exit
    * is not empty - fetch next node `N` from `queue`
4. Check `N`:
    * if `N` is `B`, the path is found, exit
    * if `N` is not `B`, go to step 3
5. If `N` is empty cell, expand search from this node
6. Repeat steps 3-6

It is important to understand how we expand nodes. For each node we offset it's _x_ and _y_ positions in all possible directions and thus make new nodes:

![Expand](/assets/posts/shisen-sho-bfs/expand.png)

If we expand a node in the same direction as parent node - we don't change number of remaining turns.

If old and new directions differ, decrease number of turns. If number of remaining turns becomes negative - stop expanding in that direction.

# 4. Implementation

_N.B. I will use Kotlin to implement the algorithm_

#### 4.1. Prepare the field

First, create an array of arrays for storing game field, where `null` is for an empty cell and `Char` is for a tile:

```kotlin
val width = 6
val height = 4
 // create field and initialize it with nulls
val gameField: Array<Array<Char?>> = Array(width + 2) { Array(height + 2) { null } }
```

Accessing tile at `(x, y)` is easy:

```kotlin
val tile: Char? = gameField[x][y]
```

The `width` and `height` are size of the puzzle, and the extra `2`'s are needed for building paths for tiles
at the edges of the field.

Now, let's throw some ~~numbers~~ tiles on the field:

```kotlin
val alphabet: MutableList<Char> = ('A'..'Z').toMutableList()
val tiles = ArrayList<Char>(width * height)
val tileCount = 4 // two pairs for each tile
for (i in 0 until (width * height / tileCount)) {
    val tile = alphabet.removeFirst()
    repeat(tileCount) {
        tiles.add(tile)
    }
}
// shuffle tiles
tiles.shuffle()
// fill the field
for (x in 1..width) {
    for (y in 1..height) {
        gameField[x][y] = tiles.removeLast()
    }
}
```

After these manipulations, our `gameField` will look like this (`.` is empty cell):

```
. . . . . . . .
. B D E F D D .
. B C C B A A .
. A C F F A D .
. E F E E C B .
. . . . . . . .
```

#### 4.2. Prepare the tools

Create `SearchNode` class, which will hold information about nodes:

```kotlin
class SearchNode(
    val x: Int, // x position of the node in the field
    val y: Int, // y position of the node in the field
    val turnsLeft: Int, // number of turns left
    val direction: Direction?, // direction of expansion, will be `null` for initial node
    val parent: SearchNode? // parent of this node, for tracking down the path
)
```

To simplify working with directions, create a separate `Direction` class with corresponding `dx` and `dy` offsets:

```kotlin
enum class Direction(
    val dx: Int,
    val dy: Int
) {
    UP(dx = 0, dy = -1),
    DOWN(dx = 0, dy = 1),
    LEFT(dx = -1, dy = 0),
    RIGHT(dx = 1, dy = 0)
}
```

`Point` class will be used to build the resulting path:

```kotlin
class Point(
    val x: Int,
    val y: Int
)
```

We will need two methods for finding a the path and expanding nodes:

```kotlin
fun findPath(
    ax: Int, ay: Int, // coordinates of the first tile
    bx: Int, by: Int // coordinates of the second tile
): List<Point> {
    TODO("Not implemented")
}

fun expand(node: SearchNode): List<SearchNode> {
    TODO("Not implemented")
}
```

#### 4.3. Implement the algorithm

Everything is ready for implementing the search algorithm.

For `findPath` we need to do the following:

1. Check if `(ax, ay)` and `(bx, by)` are not the same cell
2. Check if there're tiles at `(ax, ay)` and `(bx, by)` and their labels match
3. Create `queue` and add initial node to it (tile at `(ax, ay)`)
5. While `queue` is not empty:
    * remove first `node` from the `queue`
    * check if `node` is the target node - if it is, path found
    * if `node` is empty, expand it

The code:

```kotlin
fun findPath(
    ax: Int, ay: Int, // coordinates of the first tile
    bx: Int, by: Int // coordinates of the second tile
): List<Point> {
    if (ax == bx && ay == by) {
        // the same cell
        return emptyList()
    }
    val a = gameField[ax][ay]
    val b = gameField[bx][by]
    if (a == null || b == null || a != b) {
        // either one of cells is empty or tile labels does not match, no path
        return emptyList()
    }
    val queue = ArrayDeque<SearchNode>()
    // expand initial node
    val children = expand(
        SearchNode(x = ax, y = ay, turnsLeft = 2, direction = null, parent = null)
    )
    queue.addAll(children)
    while (queue.isNotEmpty()) {
        val node = queue.removeFirst()
        if (gameField[node.x][node.y] != null) {
            // don't need to check tile label, only coordinates
            if (node.x == bx && node.y == by) {
                // path found, trace back to build the list
                val path = ArrayList<Point>()
                var p: SearchNode? = node
                while (p != null) {
                    path.add(Point(p.x, p.y))
                    p = p.parent
                }
                return path
            } else {
                // tile itself cannot be expanded
                // continue to the next iteration
                continue
            }
        }
        // expand node
        queue.addAll(expand(node))
    }
    // there's no path between a and b
    return emptyList()
}
```

In `expand` method, for every `Direction`:

1. Calculate `turnsLeft`
    * if it's less than `0`, continue to next iteration
2. Calculate `newX` and `newY`
    * check if they're within the bounds of the field (including extra padding)
3. If all checks passed, add new node to candidates list 

In code:

```kotlin
fun expand(node: SearchNode): List<SearchNode> {
    val children = ArrayList<SearchNode>()
    for (direction in Direction.values()) {
        val turnsLeft = if (node.direction == null || node.direction == direction) {
            // if the direction is the same (or null, if it's the initial node)
            // keep turnsLeft the same
            node.turnsLeft
        } else {
            // we made a turn
            node.turnsLeft - 1
        }
        if (turnsLeft < 0) {
            // no turns left, try to expand in another direction
            continue
        }
        val newX = node.x + direction.dx
        val newY = node.y + direction.dy
        if (newX !in 0..(width + 1) || newY !in 0..(height + 1)) {
            // make sure we're not getting out of bounds
            continue
        }
        // add node to list
        children.add(SearchNode(newX, newY, turnsLeft, direction, node))
    }
    return children
}
```

Here is visualization of the algorithm (numbers - turns left, colors - iterations):

![BFS](/assets/posts/shisen-sho-bfs/bfs.gif)

# 5. Optimizations

As you can see, the algorithm also expands in directions which are guaranteed to fail.
We can use some tricks to prune unpromising nodes from the search set.

> If tiles are next to each other, no need to run BFS

[Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) is to the rescue:

![Manhattan distance](/assets/posts/shisen-sho-bfs/manhattan.png)

So, we just check if distance is 1:

```kotlin
fun manhattan(x1: Int, y1: Int, x2: Int, y2: Int): Int {
    return abs(x2 - x1) + abs(y2 - y1)
}

fun findPath(...): List<Point> {
    // ...
    if (manhattan(ax, ay, bx, by) == 1) {
        return listOf(Point(ax, ay), Point(bx, by))
    }
    // run bfs
}
```

This simple check will eliminate startup cost of BFS.

> Tiles should have at least one empty cell nearby - otherwise we can't connect the tiles (unless they are next to each other)

It's easy to see if one of the tiles is blocked, the path cannot be found:

![No empty cells](/assets/posts/shisen-sho-bfs/no-empty-cells.png)

So, let's add another check to `findPath`:

```kotlin
fun hasEmptyCells(x: Int, y: Int): Boolean {
    return x - 1 >= 0 && gameField[x - 1][y] == null ||
        x + 1 <= (width + 1) && gameField[x + 1][y] == null ||
        y - 1 >= 0 && gameField[x][y - 1] == null ||
        y + 1 <= (height + 1) && gameField[x][y + 1] == null
}

fun findPath(...): List<Point> {
    // check manhattan distance
    if (!hasEmptyCells(ax, ay) || !hasEmptyCells(bx, by)) {
        return emptyList()
    }
    // run bfs
}
```

> For the last two segments the distance to the second tile must decrease with each step - if it is not,
we can stop search in corresponding direction

Here's another place where manhattan distance comes in handy. Let's we look closely what happens when we have paths
with different number of segments:

1. For a path with one segment, either _x_ or _y_ coordinate is the same - distance always decreases
2. For a path with two segments, _x_ and _y_ coordinates differ, so one segment will close the gap by _x_ axis, and
the other will close gap by _y_ axis - distance always decreases
3. For a path with three segments, on the first segment the distance can increase, but then it will decrease
(the same as for two segments case)

For example, 3 segments path:

![Manhattan distance on each step](/assets/posts/shisen-sho-bfs/path-distance.png)

As you can see, the distance raises at the beginning (from `2` to `4`), then descreases as we approach target cell on
the _x_ and _y_ axes.

So, to improve our algorithm, we add a simple check:

```kotlin
fun expand(node: SearchNode, bx: Int, by: Int): List<SearchNode> {
    // ...
    for (direction in Direction.values()) {
        // ...
        if (turnsLeft < 2) {
            // for the last two segments the distance
            // must decrease on each step in path
            val distance = manhattan(node.x, node.y, bx, by)
            val newDistance = manhattan(newX, newY, bx, by)
            if (distance < newDistance) {
                // try another direction
                continue
            }
        }
        // add node to list
        // ...
    }
    return children
}
```

# 6. Final words

Although BFS is not the optimal solution in terms of memory, it always finds the shortest paths and thus works well for shisen-sho.

The code can be found in my repository [italankin/shisensho-base](https://github.com/italankin/shisensho-base):

* [Basic game implementation](https://github.com/italankin/shisensho-base/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/italankin/shisensho/game/impl/ShisenShoGameImpl.kt)
* [Implementation of BFS](https://github.com/italankin/shisensho-base/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/italankin/shisensho/game/impl/BfsPathFinder.kt)

And if you haven't played the game itself, you should definetely try it out. For example, download
[my Shisen-Sho for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.italankin.shisensho).

Also, [kshisen](https://apps.kde.org/kshisen/) is a good (and free) one to start, but I personally like [Kyodai Mahjongg](https://cynagames.com/) more.
